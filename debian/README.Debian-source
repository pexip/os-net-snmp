Debian modifications to .orig.tar.gz
====================================

The upstream tarball was stripped of the doc/ subdirectory because the
RFCs contained therein are indistributable under the terms of the DFSG.
No other files were changed.

Use the command
debian/rules get-orig-source
to perform these steps.
